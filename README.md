# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-for-Market-Analysis using R

- Objective: To segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns and identify key behavioral features to enhance marketing strategies and customer engagement.

- Data Processing: Processed a large credit card dataset for customer segmentation using data cleaning, R-squared feature selection, standardization, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Feature Identification: Identified key features influencing customer behavior, including transaction amount (cash advance, credit limit), payment-purchase magnitude, and full payment percentage.

- Clustering Algorithms: Employed a combination of machine learning clustering algorithms (CLARA, HKmeans, Fuzzy, Model-based, DBSCAN) to segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns.

- Model Development: Developed a VEV model (model-based clustering) that achieved the highest number of meaningful clusters, revealing insights into customer profiles such as less active users and revolvers with specific spending habits.

- Unique Insight and Impact: By strategically integrating multiple clustering techniques and developing a robust VEV model, the analysis uncovered unique customer insights. These insights can empower the marketing team to design highly personalized campaigns, which can lead to a significant increase in customer engagement and retention by precisely targeting customer needs and behaviors.
